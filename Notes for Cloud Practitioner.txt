----------------------- Cloud Practitioner------------
<Cloud Service>
4 most common types of cloud services for IaaS: Compute, Networking, Storage, Databases

<Technology Overview>
Cloud Service Provider(CSPs) that are Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS) will always have 4 core cloud service offerings:
1. Compute - EC2 Virtual Machine
2. Storage - EBS Virtual Hard Drives
3. Database - RDS SQL Databases
4. Networking - VPC Private Cloud Networking

<The Evolution of Computing>
1. Dedicated: A physical server wholly utilized by a single customer
              Guaranteed of security, privacy, and full utility of underlying resources
2. VMs: You can run multiple Virtual Machines on one Machine
        Hypervisor is the software layer that lets you run the VMs
3. Containers: Docker Deamon is the name of the software layer that lets you run multiple containers
4. Funtions: Known as Serverless Compute

<types of Cloud Computing>
1. Saas: Software as a Service (FOR CUSTOMERS)
         A product that is run and managed by the service provider
         Don't worry about how the service is maintained. It just works and remains available
2. PaaS: Platform  as a Service (FOR DEVELOPERS)
         Focus on development and management of your apps
         Don't worry about, provisioning, configuring or understanding the hardware or offerings
3. IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service (FOR ADMINS)
         The basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space
         Don't worry about IT staff, data centers and hardware

<Cloud Computing Deployment Models>
1. Pulic Cloud: Everything(the workload or project) is built on the CSP -> known as 'Cloud Native or Cloud First'
                * Companies that are starting out today, or are small enough to make the leap from a VPS to a CSP
                ex) start ups, SaaS offerings, new projects and companies
2. Private Cloud: Everything built on company's datacenters -> known as 'On-Premeise' -> Open Stack
                  * Organization that cannot run on cloud due to strict regulatory compliance or the sheer size of their Organization
                  ex) public sector-gov, super sensitive data-hospital, large enterprise with heavy regulation-insurance companies
3. Hybrid: Using both On-Premise and Cloud Service Provider
           * Organization that started with their own datacenter, can't fully move to cloud due to effort of migration or security compliance
           ex) banks, fin tech, large professional service providers, lagacy on-premise
4. Cross Cloud: Using 'Multiple Could Privders' ex)aws + azure

<AWS Account>
IAM -> Identify Account management

<AWS Regions>
Pick east region in Virginia

<Metered Billing>
Node type -> how they bill you. Pick the right bill type!
             elastic cache is default so change the node type for billing
             * There is only 1 time to get a free ticket to correct it if billing was way too much by incorrect node type

<AWS Budgets>
You can pick the budget period->monthly and how to budget->fixed
Alert -> Threshold-> 80%
Always set specific the alert method -> email, phone, text, and etc.
So, you can use the service by the budget you set up

<AWS Free Tier>
I can set up the alert when the free tier usage is approaching expirement
* My Billing Dashboard -> Billing preference -> Check on 'Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts' and 'Receive Billing Alerts'

<Billing Alarm>
type 'cloudwatch' on the top
Check the dropdown menu of 'Alarm' on the left -> Billing -> Create Alarm -> Set Metric -> Total Estimate Charge -> USD
-> traditional way is, Static->Greater->Amount of USD -> Next
-> In Alarm -> Create new topic -> Set email

<Turning on MFA> (Multi-Factor Authentication)
Need to log in as a root user
Click IAM -> Add MFA -> Activate MFA -> If you have a little physical key, choose U2F security key. If you don't have it, choose Virtual MFA Device(Phone->QR)
-> Install compatible apps -> QR Code -> Type codes

<Innovation Waves>
Kondratiev waves(Innovation waves) are hypothesized cycle-like phenomena in the global world economy
The phenomenon is closely connected with Technology life cycles
Each wave irreversibly changes the society on a global scale (PRDE: P:prosperity R:recession D:depression E:improvement)
The latest wave is Cloud Technology
A common pattern of a wave change of supply demand (Expansion->Boom->Recession->Depression)

<Burning Platform>
Burning platform is a term used WHEN A COMPANY ABANDONS OLD TECHNOLOGY FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY
with the uncertainly of success and can be motivated by fear that
the Organization future survival hinges on its DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

<Evolution of Computing Power>
Computing Power: The thoughput measured at which a computer can complete a computational task
General Computing -> Xeon CPU Processor // AWS Service Offerings -> Elastic Compute Cloud EC2
GPU Computing -> 50x faster than traditional CPUs // AWS Service Offerings -> AWS Inferentier(Inf1)
Quantum Computing -> Rigetti 16Q Aspen-4. 100 million times faster // AWS Service Offerings -> AWS Bracket

AWS Service Offerings -> AWS Bracket

<Amazon Bracket>
For using quantum computing, type 'bracket' on the top -> Amazon Bracket -> Enable Amazon Bracket
Then the screen shows all the available services that AWS Bracket offers
* It's NOT FREE! (Some of them are free for 12 months)

<The Benefits of Cloud>
1-6: Traditional Advantage, rest of them: new addition
1. Agility: increase speed and agility
2. Pay-as-you go pricing: Trade capital expense for variable expense
3. Economy of scale: Benefit from masssive economies of scale
4. Global Reach: Go global in minutes
Security
5. Reliablity: Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
High Availability
6. Scalability: Benefit from massive economies of scale
Elasticity

*Cloud Architecture - Missing: Fault Tolerance, Disaster Recovery

<The Six Advantage of Cloud>
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
    : You can 'PAY ON DEMAND' meaning there is no upfront-cost and you pay only what you consume or pay by the hour, minutes or seconds
      Instead of paying for upfront costs of data centers and servers
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
    : You are 'SHARING THE COST WITH OTHER CUSTOMERS' to get unbeatable savings
      Hundreds of thousands of customers utilizing a fraction of a server
3. Stop guessing capacity
    : 'SCALE UP AND DOWN' to meet the current need. Launch and destroy services whenever
      Instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers
4. Increase speed and agility
    : 'LAUNCH RESOURCES WITHIN A FEW CLICKS IN MUNITES'
      Instead of waiting days or weeks of your IT to implement the solution on-premise
5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
    : 'FOCUS ON YOUR OWN CUSTOMERS', developing and configuring your applications
      Instead of operations such as of racking, stacking, and powering servers
6. Go global in minutes
    : 'DEPLOY YOUR APP IN MULTIPLE REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD WITH A FEW CLICKS'
      Provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost

<Seven Advantages to Cloud>
Andrew Brown's own defined Advantages
1. Cost effective
2. Global
3. Secure
4. Reliable
5. Scalable
6. Elastic
7. Current

<AWS Global Infrastructure Overview>
'GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED HARDWARE AND DATACENTERS' that are 'PHYSICALLY NETWORKED TOGETHER' to act as one large resource for the end customer
AWS Global Infrastructure is made up of the following resources:
1. 25 Launched Regions
2. 81 Availability Zones
3. 108 Direct Connection Locations
4. 275+ Points of Presence
5. 11 Local Zone
6. 17 Wavelength Zones

<AWS Golbal Infrastructure - Regions>
'GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTINCT LOCATIONS' consisting of one or more Availability Zones
Every region is 'PHYSICALLY ISOLATED' from and independent of every other region in terms of 'LOCATION, POWER, WATER SUPPLY'
* Most important region: AWS First Region 2006, US-EAST1(Northern Virginia)

each region generally has 3 Avaiable zones
New services almost always become availalbe first in 'US-EAST'
Not all AWS Services are avaiable in all Regions

When you choose a region there are 4 factors you need to consider:
1. What Regulatory Compliance does this region meet?
2. What is the cost of AWS services in this region?
3. What AWS services are available in this region?
4. What is the distance or latency to my end-users?

<Regions vs Global Services>
Regional Services: AWS 'SCOPES' their AWS Management Console on a selected Region (on the top of the right corner)
                   This will determine 'WHERE' an AWS service will be launched and what will be seen within an AWS service's console
                   You generally don't explicitly set the region for a service at the time of creation
Global Services: Some AWS Services operate across multiple regions and the region will be fixed to 'Global'
                 ex) Amazon S3, Cloud Front, Route53, IAM
For these global services at the time of creation:
1. There is no concept of region -> ex) IAM user
2. A single region must be explicitly chosen -> ex) S3 Bucket
3. A group of regions are chosen -> ex) CloudFront Distribution

<Availability Zone(AZs)>
AZ is a physical location made up of one or more datacenter
A datacenter is a secured building that contains hundreds of thousands of computers
A region will *GENERALLY contain 3 Availability zones

Datacenters within a region will be isolated from each other(different buildings)
But they will be close enough to provide low latency(<10ms)

Its common practice to run workloads in at least 3AZs to ensure services remain available in case one or two datacenters fail(high Availability)
AZs are represented by a Region Code, followed by a letter identifier ex)us-east-1a

A Subnet is associated with an Availability Zone
You never choose the AZ when launching resources. You choose the Subnet which is associated to the AZ
The US-EAST-1 region has 6AZs(the most Availability Zone of any region)

<Regions and AZ Vizualized>
A region has multiple Availability zones
An Availability Zone is made up of 'ONE OR MORE' datacenters
All AZs in an AWS Region are interconnected with high-bandwith, low-latency networking, over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber
providing high-throughput, low-latency networking between
All traffic between AZs is encrypted
AZs are within 100km (60miles) of each other

<Selecting Regions and AZs Following Along>
Witin AWS, select region(top right corner)->select regional service(eg.EC2) in the search on the top->go to instances->select Amazon Linux2->next->
select 'Subnet' which associated to a Availability Zone(eg.US-EAST1 has 6 of them>>us-east1-1a,us-east1-1b...us-east1-1f)

search global service eg.S3 on the top->create bucket->under AWS region, select region but we don't choose Availability Zone because AWS runs these in multiple AZs

search cloud service eg.cloudfront->create distribution->under settings, price class, choose which one you want, all locations or only NA and EU or NA and EU and ASIA and AF and ME

IAM->Access Management->User Groups->Create user group-> actually there is no region for IAM

<Fault Tolerance>
Fault Domain: a section of a network that is vulnerable to damage if a critical device or system fails. 
The purpose of a fault domain is that if a failure occurs 'IT WILL NOT CASCADE OUTSIDE THAT DOMAIN', limiting the damage possible

You can have fault domains nested inside fault domains

Fault Level: a collection of fault domains

The scope of a fault domain could be: specific servers in a rack
                                      an entire rack in a datacenter
                                      an entire room in a datacenter
                                      the entire data center building
Its up to the Cloud Service Provider(CSPs) to define the bounderies of a domain
an AWS Region would be a FAULT LEVEL
a Availability Zone would be a FAULT DOMAIN

Each Amazon Region is designed to be completely 'ISOLATED' from the other Amazon Region
- this acheives the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability
Each Availability Zone is ISOLATED, but the Availability Zones in a Region are connected through low-latency
Each Availability Zone is designed as an 'INDEPENDENT FAILURE ZONE'
-'failure zone' is AWS describing a Fault Domain

Failure Zone
Availability Zones are physically seperated within a typical metropolitan region and are located in lower risk flood plains
Discrete uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and onsite backup generation facilities
Data centers located in different Availability Zones are designed to be supplied by independent substations to reduce the risk of an event on the power grid
impacting more than one Availability Zone
Availability Zones are all redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit provider

Multi AZs for high Availability
If an application is partitions across AZs, companies are better isolated and protected from issues such as
POWER OUTAGES, LIGHTNENG STRIKES, TONADOES, EARTHQUAKES, and more

<AWS Global Network>
AWS Global Network represent the 'INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN AWS GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE'
Commonly referred to as the 'The Backbone of AWS'

Edge Locations can act as 'ON AND OFF RAMPS' to the AWS Global Network
(On Ramp) AWS Global Accelerator/AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration - Uses Edge Locations as an on-ramp to quickly reach AWS resources in other regions 
                                                                by traversing the fast AWS Global Network
(Off Ramp) Amazon CloudFront(CDN) - Uses Edge Locations as an off-ramp to provide at the edge storage and compute near the end user
VPC Endpoint - Ensuring your resources stay within the AWS Network and do no traverse over the public internet

<Points of Presence(PoP)>
An intermediate location between an AWS Regions and the end user, and this location could be a datacenter or collection of hardware
For AWS a Point of Presence is a data center 'OWNED BY AWS OR A TRUSTED PARTNER' that is utilized by AWS Services related 'FOR CONTENT DELIVERY OR EXPEDIATED UPLOAD'
Pop resources are: Edge Locations, Regional Edge Caches

EDGE LOCATIONS are datacenters that hold cached(copy) on the most popular files (eg.web pages, images and videos) so that the delivery of distance to the end users are reduce
REGIONAL EDGE LOCATIONS are datacenters that hold much larger caches of less popular files to reduce a full round trip and also to reduce the cost of transfer fees

<Tier 1>
*Pops live at the edge/INTERSECTION of two networks
Tier 1 network: a network that can reach every other network on the internet WITHOUT PURCHEASING IP TRANSIT OR PATYING FOR PEERING
AWS Availability Zones are all redundantly connected to multiple TIER 1 TRANSIT providers

<AWS Services using PoPs>
The following AWS Services use PoPs FOR CONTENT DELIVERY OR EXPEDIATED UPLOAD

Amazon CloudFront is a CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK(CDN) SERVICE that:
1. You point your website to cloudfront so that it will route requests to nearest Edge Location cache
2. allows you to choose an ORIGIN (such as a web server or storage) that will be source of cached
3. caches the contents of what origin would returned to various Edge Locations around the world

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration allows you to generate a special URL that can be used by end users to upload files to a nearby Edge Location.
Once a file is uploaded to an Edge Location, it can move much faster within the AWS Network to reach S3

AWS Global Accelerator can find the optimal path from the end user to your web servers. Global Accelerator are deployed within Edge Locations
so you send user traffic to an Edge Location instead of directly to your web application

<AWS Direct Connect>
AWS Direct Connect: a PRIVATE/DEDICATED CONNECTION BETWEEN DATACENTER, OFFICE, CO-LOCATION AND AWS
Direct Connect has tWO VERY FAST NETWORK connection options:
1. Lower Bandwidth: 50MBps - 500MBps
2. Higher Bandwidth: 1GBps or 10GBps
Helps REDUCE NETWORK COSTS and INCREASE BANDWIDTH THROUGHPUT(great for high traffic networks)
Provides a MORE CONSISTENT NETWORK EXPERIENCE than a typical internet based connection(reliable and secure)

A co-location (aka carrier-hotel) is a datacenter where equipment, space, and bandwith are available for rental to retail customers

<Direct Connection Locations>
Direct Connection Locations: 'TRUSTED PARTNERED DATACENTERS' that you can establish A DEDICATED HIGH SPEED, LOW LATENCY CONNECTION FROM YOUR ON-PREMISE TO AWS
You would use the AWS DIRECT CONNECT service to order and establish a connection

<AWS Local Zones>
Local Zones: datacenters located very close to a densely populated area to provide single digit millisecond low latency performance (eg 7ms) for that area
Los Angeles, CA was the first local zone to be deployed
- It is a logical extension of the US-West-Region (we-west-2-lax-1a)
- Only specific AWS services have been made available(EC2 Instant Types, EBS, Amazon FSx, Application Load Balancer, Amazon VPC)
The purpose of Local Zone is the support highly demanding applications that sensitive latencies:
Media & Entertainment, Electonic Design Automation, Ad-Tech, Machine Learning

<Wavelength Zones>
AWS Wavelength Zones: allows for EDGE-COMPUTING ON 5G NETWORKS
Applications will have 'ULTRA LOW-LATENCY' being as close as possible to the users
AWS has partnered with various Telecome comapnies to utilize their 5G networks(Verizon, SK Telecom)
You Create the Subnet tied to a Wavelength Zone and then you can launch Virtual Machine(VM) to the edge of the targeted 5G networks
(EC2, need low latency -> with those Wavelength Zones -> super low latency)

<Data Residency>
Data Residency: The physical or geographic location of where an Organization or cloud resources reside
-> not guarantee. just says where the data is
Compliance Bounderies: A regulatory compliance (legal requirement) by a government Organization that describes where data and cloud resources are allowed to reside
-> contorls that are in place to say data stays where we want to be
Data Sovereignty: The jurisdictional control or legal authority that can be asserted over data because it's physical location is within jurisdictional bounderies
-> idea of scope of the legal stuff that ties in with compliance bounderies

How AWS make sure the compliance bounderies and data Sovereignty?
Opt 1. AWS OUTPOST is PHYSICAL RACK OF SERVERS that you can put it your datacenter. Your data will reside whenever the Outpost physically resides
Opt 2. AWS CONFIG is a Policy as Code service. You can create rules to continuous check AWS resources configuration
If they deviate from your expectations you are alerted or AWS Config can in some cases auto remediate
In order to prevent all together..
IAM POLICIES can be written explicitly deny access to specific AWS regions. A Service Control Policy(SCP) are permissions appliced Organization wide

<AWS for Government>
