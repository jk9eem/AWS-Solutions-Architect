----------------------- Cloud Practitioner------------
<Cloud Service>
4 most common types of cloud services for IaaS: Compute, Networking, Storage, Databases

<Technology Overview>
Cloud Service Provider(CSPs) that are Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS) will always have 4 core cloud service offerings:
1. Compute - EC2 Virtual Machine
2. Storage - EBS Virtual Hard Drives
3. Database - RDS SQL Databases
4. Networking - VPC Private Cloud Networking

<The Evolution of Computing>
1. Dedicated: A physical server wholly utilized by a single customer
              Guaranteed of security, privacy, and full utility of underlying resources
2. VMs: You can run multiple Virtual Machines on one Machine
        Hypervisor is the software layer that lets you run the VMs
3. Containers: Docker Deamon is the name of the software layer that lets you run multiple containers
4. Funtions: Known as Serverless Compute

<types of Cloud Computing>
1. Saas: Software as a Service (FOR CUSTOMERS)
         A product that is run and managed by the service provider
         Don't worry about how the service is maintained. It just works and remains available
2. PaaS: Platform  as a Service (FOR DEVELOPERS)
         Focus on development and management of your apps
         Don't worry about, provisioning, configuring or understanding the hardware or offerings
3. IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service (FOR ADMINS)
         The basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space
         Don't worry about IT staff, data centers and hardware

<Cloud Computing Deployment Models>
1. Pulic Cloud: Everything(the workload or project) is built on the CSP -> known as 'Cloud Native or Cloud First'
                * Companies that are starting out today, or are small enough to make the leap from a VPS to a CSP
                ex) start ups, SaaS offerings, new projects and companies
2. Private Cloud: Everything built on company's datacenters -> known as 'On-Premeise' -> Open Stack
                  * Organization that cannot run on cloud due to strict regulatory compliance or the sheer size of their Organization
                  ex) public sector-gov, super sensitive data-hospital, large enterprise with heavy regulation-insurance companies
3. Hybrid: Using both On-Premise and Cloud Service Provider
           * Organization that started with their own datacenter, can't fully move to cloud due to effort of migration or security compliance
           ex) banks, fin tech, large professional service providers, lagacy on-premise
4. Cross Cloud: Using 'Multiple Could Privders' ex)aws + azure

<AWS Account>
IAM -> Identify Account management

<AWS Regions>
Pick east region in Virginia

<Metered Billing>
Node type -> how they bill you. Pick the right bill type!
             elastic cache is default so change the node type for billing
             * There is only 1 time to get a free ticket to correct it if billing was way too much by incorrect node type

<AWS Budgets>
You can pick the budget period->monthly and how to budget->fixed
Alert -> Threshold-> 80%
Always set specific the alert method -> email, phone, text, and etc.
So, you can use the service by the budget you set up

<AWS Free Tier>
I can set up the alert when the free tier usage is approaching expirement
* My Billing Dashboard -> Billing preference -> Check on 'Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts' and 'Receive Billing Alerts'

<Billing Alarm>
type 'cloudwatch' on the top
Check the dropdown menu of 'Alarm' on the left -> Billing -> Create Alarm -> Set Metric -> Total Estimate Charge -> USD
-> traditional way is, Static->Greater->Amount of USD -> Next
-> In Alarm -> Create new topic -> Set email

<Turning on MFA> (Multi-Factor Authentication)
Need to log in as a root user
Click IAM -> Add MFA -> Activate MFA -> If you have a little physical key, choose U2F security key. If you don't have it, choose Virtual MFA Device(Phone->QR)
-> Install compatible apps -> QR Code -> Type codes

<Innovation Waves>
Kondratiev waves(Innovation waves) are hypothesized cycle-like phenomena in the global world economy
The phenomenon is closely connected with Technology life cycles
Each wave irreversibly changes the society on a global scale (PRDE: P:prosperity R:recession D:depression E:improvement)
The latest wave is Cloud Technology
A common pattern of a wave change of supply demand (Expansion->Boom->Recession->Depression)

<Burning Platform>
Burning platform is a term used WHEN A COMPANY ABANDONS OLD TECHNOLOGY FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY
with the uncertainly of success and can be motivated by fear that
the Organization future survival hinges on its DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

<Evolution of Computing Power>
Computing Power: The thoughput measured at which a computer can complete a computational task
General Computing -> Xeon CPU Processor // AWS Service Offerings -> Elastic Compute Cloud EC2
GPU Computing -> 50x faster than traditional CPUs // AWS Service Offerings -> AWS Inferentier(Inf1)
Quantum Computing -> Rigetti 16Q Aspen-4. 100 million times faster // AWS Service Offerings -> AWS Bracket

AWS Service Offerings -> AWS Bracket

<Amazon Bracket>
For using quantum computing, type 'bracket' on the top -> Amazon Bracket -> Enable Amazon Bracket
Then the screen shows all the available services that AWS Bracket offers
* It's NOT FREE! (Some of them are free for 12 months)

<The Benefits of Cloud>
1-6: Traditional Advantage, rest of them: new addition
1. Agility: increase speed and agility
2. Pay-as-you go pricing: Trade capital expense for variable expense
3. Economy of scale: Benefit from masssive economies of scale
4. Global Reach: Go global in minutes
Security
5. Reliablity: Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
High Availability
6. Scalability: Benefit from massive economies of scale
Elasticity

*Cloud Architecture - Missing: Fault Tolerance, Disaster Recovery

<The Six Advantage of Cloud>
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
    : You can 'PAY ON DEMAND' meaning there is no upfront-cost and you pay only what you consume or pay by the hour, minutes or seconds
      Instead of paying for upfront costs of data centers and servers
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
    : You are 'SHARING THE COST WITH OTHER CUSTOMERS' to get unbeatable savings
      Hundreds of thousands of customers utilizing a fraction of a server
3. Stop guessing capacity
    : 'SCALE UP AND DOWN' to meet the current need. Launch and destroy services whenever
      Instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers
4. Increase speed and agility
    : 'LAUNCH RESOURCES WITHIN A FEW CLICKS IN MUNITES'
      Instead of waiting days or weeks of your IT to implement the solution on-premise
5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
    : 'FOCUS ON YOUR OWN CUSTOMERS', developing and configuring your applications
      Instead of operations such as of racking, stacking, and powering servers
6. Go global in minutes
    : 'DEPLOY YOUR APP IN MULTIPLE REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD WITH A FEW CLICKS'
      Provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost
